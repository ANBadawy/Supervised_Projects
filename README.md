# Project Overview:
This project involves the application of multiple classical machine learning algorithms to solve predictive modeling problems. The project is structured into two distinct parts: linear and non-linear approaches. Each part focuses on leveraging appropriate algorithms to address specific types of data patterns and relationships.

# Key Components:

- ## Linear Approaches:

-- Linear Classification: Implemented to classify data points into distinct categories using linear decision boundaries.

-- Linear Regression: Applied to model and predict continuous outcomes based on linear relationships between independent and dependent variables.

- ## Non-Linear Approaches:

-- Kernel Trick: Utilized to transform data into higher-dimensional spaces, enabling the capture of complex, non-linear patterns.

-- Decision Trees: Employed to create hierarchical structures for decision-making, capable of handling non-linear relationships and interactions.

-- Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Applied with non-linear kernels to classify data by identifying optimal hyperplanes in transformed feature spaces.

Methodology:

- Data preprocessing, including normalization and feature engineering, to ensure optimal model performance.

- Model training, validation, and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (MSE).

- Comparative analysis of linear and non-linear approaches to determine the most effective solution for the given problem.

Outcome:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in handling both linear and non-linear problems. By comparing the performance of various algorithms, it provides insights into selecting the right approach for different types of data and predictive tasks.
